## Eye Exercise

This is a JavaScript code that creates a mouse move effect on two ball-shaped elements on a webpage. It starts by selecting the HTML elements with the class "ball" and storing them in an array called "balls" using the getElementsByClassName() method. Then, it sets up an event listener for the "mousemove" event on the document object. The code inside the event listener calculates the x and y coordinates of the mouse relative to the viewport and uses them to set the CSS properties of the two ball elements. Specifically, it sets the "left" and "top" properties to the x and y coordinates respectively and sets the "transform" property to a translation value that moves the balls in the opposite direction of the mouse movement. The for loop is used to apply these styles to both ball elements. Overall, this code creates a simple and interactive visual effect on a webpage.

## Roadmaps

Add more balls: You could add more balls to the page, making the effect more dynamic and visually interesting. You could also adjust the size and color of the balls to make them stand out from one another.

Change the direction of the balls: Currently, the balls move in the same direction as the mouse. You could change the direction of some of the balls to move in a different direction or to move in random directions.

Add interaction: You could add interaction to the balls, such as making them expand or shrink when clicked, or changing their color when hovered over.

Change the background: You could add a background to the page or change the background color to make the effect more visually interesting.

Add animations: You could add animations to the balls, such as making them bounce or spin, to make the effect more dynamic.
